# SwiftEverywhere

## Raspberry Pi

For this experiment, a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.4

I used a 258GB mini-SD card. Origianlly I used an 8GB card but it as not enough for installing Swift.

I installed Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit), using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software)

When you reach the option to set "customizations":


## Local Development

* Download Visual Studio Code
* Install the Microsoft Remote - SSH to run on Pi from Mac

## Run

nohup swift run > output.log 2>&1 &
